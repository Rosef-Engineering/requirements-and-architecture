## Let's Electrify Africa 
   

This repository is a part of Rosef's efforts at developing <!-- The goal of Rosef is to develop // This project is a part of Rosef's efforts at developing -->a sustainable solution for electrification, with the main focus being on Africa. More specifically, our target is to start with homes and small businesses in Africa. Owing to the weather conditions in the majority of our target region, solar (photovoltaic) power is the basis of our solution.  
  
Stemming from our goal of minimizing system cost without making compromises, the three key technical concepts of our approach are:  
- **Use of direct energy storage methods**  
Lowering the dependency of renewables on lithium batteries which are expensive and have limited sustainability.  
- **Moving towards the DC future**  
Removing redundant AC/DC conversion and the associated power losses and investment costs.  
- **A smart system which manages resources seamlessly**  
Avoiding compromises and keeping convenience without oversizing the system.

## System Architecture
  
Derived from the concepts above, as well as the needs of our target application, Fig. 1 below depicts a high-level overview of the proposed architecture of a domestic electric installation.

Our goal is to develop the system in the schematic above, but our plan is to focus first on the subset shown below in Fig. 3.

## Repository Content

The goal of this repository and its contents is to document the design of the system and its components in order to enable technical discussions and development coordination. In the long term, the target is to have detailed requirements and architecture, assuring traceability and consistency throughout the development process.  
Currently, the block diagrams are created in [Ipe](https://ipe.otfried.org/), exported in svg format and combined with markdown text. In addition, some parts, which are best suited for tabular representation, are in the form of spreadsheets.
