Rosef's goal is to develop a solution which will enable the electrification of developing countries in Africa. The solution, thus, must be cost effective. That being said, another goal of Rosef is for the solution to be without compromises. As these two objectives might be difficult to quantify, and as they are at odds, more detailed decisions will have to be made during the development process.
